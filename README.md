# AutoCompleteCountrySelector
Android (Java) - Auto Complete Country Selector Demo

App created in Android Studio 3.2.1 and tested on a Google Nexus 6P API 27 Android 8_1_0 Emulator

To use this app the user just clicks the 'Country Selector' demo app icon and they are taken right into the demo. 
They are greeted with a World Globe graphic on the top with a textView line under that says "Select A Country". 
Following right below is a AutoCompleteTextView where a hint is shown "Type in a Country Name". As the user clicks the line
a pop up keyboard pops up from below. The user just needs to start typing as a number of country name options pop up. 
When the correct country is shown the user just clicks the name and it is populated on the AutoCompleteTextView line.

Coming soon: Screen cap images of the app in use can be found on <a href="http://digitalmirko.com/javaApps.html">Digital Mirko</a>.
